# Usage

Start the Connector by using the desktop icon.

If you are running a demo or trial version, a message box will inform you right away. Otherwise if you have a valid license you will see the details in the top right corner in green. 

Upon the first start or whenever you change the event you want to work with go through this [settings information](configuration.md).
